    "### Task 1\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **At what temperature did outputs start varying between runs?**\n",
    "   - Around temperature 0.5-0.7, though variation is more noticeable at 1.0+\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **For answering factual questions, what temperature would you use?**\n",
    "   - Temperature 0 for consistent, deterministic answers\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **For creative writing, what temperature range works best?**\n",
    "   - 0.7-1.0 provides good balance between creativity and coherence\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 2\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Which component had the biggest impact on output quality?**\n",
    "   - Format and Audience typically have the largest impact, as they directly affect structure and language level\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **When might you skip some components to save tokens?**\n",
    "   - Simple, straightforward tasks\n",
    "   - When token budget is limited\n",
    "   - For exploratory or creative tasks where less structure is better\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How did adding specific data change the output?**\n",
    "   - Ensures required information is included\n",
    "   - Grounds the response in specific examples\n",
    "   - Makes output more directly useful\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 3\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Which greetings showed disagreement between approaches?**\n",
    "   - Borderline cases like \"Hi there\" or mixed-tone greetings\n",
    "   - Greetings with context-dependent formality\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Did few-shot perform better than zero-shot?**\n",
    "   - Yes, examples help clarify the boundaries between categories\n",
    "   - Particularly helpful for ambiguous cases\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What makes a good few-shot example?**\n",
    "   - Clear and unambiguous\n",
    "   - Diverse across the spectrum\n",

    "2. **When would you use few-shot CoT vs zero-shot CoT?**\n",
    "   - Few-shot: When you need specific format or style of reasoning\n",
    "   - Zero-shot: For simpler problems or when you want flexible reasoning\n",

### Model I/O: Loading Quantized Models with LangChain

As in previous chapters, we will be using Phi-3 GGUF (GPT-Generated Unified Format) model variant.

A **GGUF** model represents a compressed version of its original counterpart through a method called **quantization**, which *reduces the number of bits needed to represent the parameters of an LLM.*
![[Pasted image 20251021141524.png]]


> [!tip] Quantization
> **Quantization** reduces the number of bits required to represent the parameters the parameters of an LLM while attempting most of the original information. This could cause some reduction in precision. But this loss is made up for in speed, and lower resource needs (requires less VRAM). 

Know that for the rest of the chapter, we will be using an 8-bit variant of Phi-3 compared to the original 16-bit variant, cutting memory requirements almost in half.

First, we need to download the model. `FP16`, the chosen model, represents the **16-bit** variant.

```markdown
!wget https://huggingface.co.microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-gguf/resolve/main/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-fp16.gguf
```

We use `llama-cpp-python` together with LangChain to load the GGUF file:
```python
from langchain import LLamaCpp

# Make sure the model path is correct for your system
llm = LlamaCpp(
	model_path = "Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-fp16.gguf",
	n_gpu_layers = -1 # -1 means you want all the layers to use the GPU.
	max_tokens = 500,
	n_ctx = 2048, # this defines the context length, discussed in previous chapters
	seed = 42,
	verbose = False
	)
```

In LangChain, we use the `invoke` function to generate output:
```python
llm.invoke("Hi! My name is Maarten. What is 1 + 1?")
```

This outputs:
```markdown
''
```

As you can see, there is no output. Looking back to the previous chapters, we know `Phi-3` requires a specific prompt template. But instead of having to use this template every time, we could instead use **LangChain**'s core functionality, called '*chains*'.

#### Chains: Extending the Capabilities of LLMs

Although LLMs can be run in isolation, chains allow for better integration with tools, agent-like behavior, and combination with other tools.

The most basic form of a chain in LangChain is a single chain. Although a chain can vary in complexity and form, it generally connects an LLM with some additional tool, prompt or feature.

![[Pasted image 20251023130128.png]]


#### A Single Link in the Chain: Prompt Template

We start with creating our first chain, namely the prompt template that `Phi-3` expects. 
![[Pasted image 20251023130435.png]]

The template for `Phi-3` is comprised of **four main components:**
- `<s>` to indicate when the prompt starts
- `<|user|>` to indicate the start of the user's prompt
- `<|assistant|>` to indicate the start of the model's output
- `<|end|>` to indicate the end of either the prompt or the model's output

The diagram below further illustrates this with an example:
![[Pasted image 20251023131145.png]]

**Let's try this with a real example:**

To generate our simple chain, we first need to create a prompt template that adheres to `Phi-3`'s expected template. Using this template, the model takes in a `system_prompt`, which generally describes what we expect from the LLM. 

Then we can use the `input_prompt` to ask the LLM specific questions:
```python
from langchain import PromptTemplate 

# Create a prompt template with the "input_prompt" variable
template = """<s><|user|>
	{input_prompt}<|end|>
	<|assistant|>"""
prompt = PromptTemplate(
	template = template,
	input_variables = ["input_prompt"]
)
```

To create our first chain, we can use both the prompt that we created and the LLM and chain them together:
```python
basic_chain = prompt | llm # llm is the Phi-3 GGUF we defined early in the chapter
```

To use the chain, we need to use the `invoke` function

```python
basic_chain.invoke(
	{
		"input_prompt": "Hi! My name is Maarten. What is 1 + 1?",
	}
)
```

This outputs:
```markdown
The answer to 1 + 1 is 2. It's a basic arithmetic operation where you add one unit to another, resulting in two units altogether.
```

This output gives us the response without any unnecessary tokens. Now that we have created this chain, we do not have to create the prompt template from scratch every time we use the LLM.

> [!info] NOTE
> While `Phi-3` and other models expect a specific template, other models like ChatGPT handles the underlying template.

#### A Chain with Multiple Prompts

In our previous example, we created a single chain consisting of a prompt template an an LLM. Because the previous prompt was pretty straightforward and contains one task (e.g., adding 1 + 1), the LLM was able to handle it with no issues. 

This is not always the case. Some prompts could be more complex and contain multiple tasks and dimensions. Giving a this as an input to an LLM could produce poor results. 

**Prompt chaining**, as seen in Chapter 6, addresses this. 

Instead of providing an LLM with a long, complex prompt, we break it down to multiple chained prompts. If you remember, the example in chapter 6 was asking the LLM to generate a *name*, a *slogan*, and a *business plan*. 

Below, this method is illustrated:
![[Pasted image 20251023135209.png]]

Let's try a new example. Assume we want to generate a story that has three components:
- A title
- A description
- A summary of the story

To generate that story, we use LangChain to describe the first component, namely the title. The first link is the only component that requires user input, we define the "summary".

```python
from langchain import LLMChain

# Create a chain for the title of our story
template = """<s><|user|>
Create a title for a story about {summary}. Only return the title.
<|end|>
<|assistant|>"""

title_prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=["summary"])
title = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt = title_pompt, output_key = title)
```

Let’s run an example:
```python
title.invoke({"summary": "a girl that lost her mother"})
```

This outputs:
```markdown
{'summary': 'a girl that lost her mother',
'title': ' "Whispers of Loss: A Journey Through Grief"'}
```

Using the generated output, let's generate the next component, the "description".

```python
# Create a chain for the character description using the summary and title

template = """<s><|user|>
Describe the main character of a story about {summary} with the
title {title}. Use only two sentences.<|end|>
<|assistant|>"""

character_prompt = PromptTemplate(
	template=template, input_variables=["summary", "title"]
)
character = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=character_prompt, output_key="character")
```

Now let's create a short description of the story using all the components we have. 
```python
# Create a chain for the story using the summary, title, and character description
template = """<s><|user|>
Create a story about {summary} with the title {title}. The main
character is: {character}. Only return the story and it cannot be
longer than one paragraph. <|end|>
<|assistant|>"""

story_prompt = PromptTemplate(
	template=template, input_variables=["summary", "title",
	"character"]
)
story = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=story_prompt, output_key="story")
```

Now that we have created all three components, we can link them together to create our full chain:

```python
# Combine all three components to generate a story
llm_chain = title | character | story
```

This outputs:
```markdown
{'summary': 'a girl that lost her mother',
'title': ' "In Loving Memory: A Journey Through Grief"',
'character': ' The protagonist, Emily, is a resilient young girl who struggles to cope with her overwhelming grief after losing her beloved and caring mother at an early age. As she embarks on a journey of self-discovery and healing, she learnsvaluable life lessons from the memories and wisdom shared by those around her.',
'story': " In Loving Memory: A Journey Through Grief revolves around Emily, a resilient young girl who loses her beloved mother at an early age. Struggling to cope with overwhelming grief, she embarks on a journey of self-discovery and healing, drawing strength from the cherished memories and wisdom shared by those around her. Through this transformative process, Emily learns valuable life lessons about resilience, love, and the power of human connection, ultimately finding solace in honoring her mother's legacy while embracing a newfound sense of inner peace amidst the painful loss."}
```

#### Memory: Helping LLMs to Remember Conversations

When we use LLMs out of the box (basic inference), they will not remember what was being said in a conversation. Any information shared in one prompt will not be remembered in the next.

Let's test this with code:
```python
# Let's give the LLM our name
basic_chain.invoke({"input_prompt": "Hi! My name is Maarten. What is 1 + 1?"})
```

```markdown
Hello Maarten! The answer to 1 + 1 is 2.
```

Now let's see if it can remember the name we have provided.

```python
# Next, we ask the LLM to reproduce the name  
basic_chain.invoke({"input_prompt": "What is my name?"})
```

```markdown
I'm sorry, but as a language model, I don't have the ability to know personal information about individuals. You can provide the name you'd like to know more about, and I can help you with information or general inquiries related to it.
```

The reason for this behavior is that these models are stateless. It does not store any memory of past interactions. **Every transaction is handled as if it were the first time.**

To make these models **stateful**, we can add specific types of memory to the chain that we created earlier. 

In this section, we will go through **two common methods** for helping LLMs to remember conversations:
- **Conversation buffer**
- **Conversation summary**
![[Pasted image 20251023144903.png]]


#### Conversation Buffer

This method is basically reminding LLMs of what has happened in the past. 

As can be seen in the diagram below, this can be done by copying the full conversation history and pasting it to the prompt.

![[Pasted image 20251023145637.png]]


In LangChain, this form of memory is called a **`ConversationBufferMemory`**. 

```python 
# Create an updated prompt template to include a chat history

template = """<s><|user|>Current conversation:{chat_history}
{input_prompt}<|end|>
<|assistant|>"""

prompt = PromptTemplate(
	template=template,
	input_variables=["input_prompt", "chat_history"] # additional "chat_history" variable
)
```

Notice that we added an additional input variable `chat_history`. This variable holds the conversation history.

Next, we can create LangChain's `ConversationBufferMemory` and assign it to the `chat_history` variable.

```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

# Define the type of memory we will use
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history")

# Chain the LLM, prompt, and memory together
llm_chain = LLMChain(
	prompt=prompt,
	llm=llm,
	memory=memory
)
```

Let's check whether we did this correctly:

```python
# Generate a conversation and ask a basic question

llm_chain.invoke({"input_prompt": "Hi! My name is Maarten. What is 1 + 1?"})
```

```markdown
{'input_prompt': 'Hi! My name is Maarten. What is 1 + 1?',
'chat_history': ',
'text': " Hello Maarten! The answer to 1 + 1 is 2. Hope you're having a great day!"}
```

You can find the generated text in the '`text`' key, the input prompt in '`input_prompt`', and the chat history in '`chat_history`'.

As you can see, `chat_history: `, there is no chat history as this is the first time we used this specific chain.

Let's try again:
```python
# Does the LLM remember the name we gave it?
llm_chain.invoke({"input_prompt": "What is my name?"})
```

```markdown
{'input_prompt': 'What is my name?',
'chat_history': "Human: Hi! My name is Maarten. What is 1 + 1?
\nAI: Hello Maarten! The answer to 1 + 1 is 2. Hope you're having a great day!",
'text': ' Your name is Maarten.'}
```
![[Pasted image 20251023151734.png]]

By using `chat_history`, the LLM is able to retrieve the name.

#### Windowed Conversation Buffer

While using the entire previous chat history as an input is effective in retrieving information and creating memory, this creates a problem. 

We know that every LLM has ***content window***, a number of total tokens a model can take in as input. As the conversation goes on, the context window is reached fast.

One method of addressing that is by using only the last *k* conversations instead of using the entire history. 

In LangChain, we use **`ConversationBufferWindowMemory`** to decide how many past conversations to include in memory. 

```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory

# Retain only the last 2 conversations in memory
memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=2, memory_key="chat_history")

# Chain the LLM, prompt, and memory together
llm_chain = LLMChain(
	prompt=prompt,
	llm=llm,
	memory=memory
)
```

Let's try out a series of questions:
```python
# Ask two questions and generate two conversations in its memory
llm_chain.predict(input_prompt="Hi! My name is Maarten and I am 33 years old. What is 1 + 1?")

llm_chain.predict(input_prompt="What is 3 + 3?")
```

This outputs:

```markdown
{'input_prompt': 'What is 3 + 3?',
'chat_history': "Human: Hi! My name is Maarten and I am 33 years old. What is 1 + 1?\nAI: Hello Maarten! It's nice to meet you. Regarding your question, 1 + 1 equals 2. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!\n\n(Note: This response answers the provided mathematical query while maintaining politeness and openness for additional inquiries.)",
'text': " Hello Maarten! It's nice to meet you as well. Regarding your new question, 3 + 3 equals 6. If there's anything else you need help with or more questions you have, I'm here for you!"}
```

The interaction we had this far is shown in `chat_history`. Note that under the hood, LangChain saves it as an interaction between the user (shown as `Human`) and the LLM (shown as `AI`).

Let's check whether it can answer a question regarding the name:
```python
# Check whether it knows the name we gave it
llm_chain.invoke({"input_prompt":"What is my name?"})
```

```markdown
{'input_prompt': 'What is my name?',
'chat_history': "Human: Hi! My name is Maarten and I am 33 years old. What is 1 + 1?\nAI: Hello Maarten! It's nice to meet you. Regarding your question, 1 + 1 equals 2. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free toask!\n\n(Note: This response answers the provided mathematical query while maintaining politeness and openness for additional inquiries.)\nHuman: What is 3 + 3?\nAI: Hello Maarten! It's
nice to meet you as well. Regarding your new question, 3 + 3
equals 6. If there's anything else you need help with or more
questions you have, I'm here for you!",
'text': ' Your name is Maarten, as mentioned at the beginning
of our conversation. Is there anything else you would like to
know or discuss?'}
```

Based on the output in '`text`' it correctly remembers the name we gave it. Note that the chat history is updated with the previous question.

We know that we set `k = 2` for `ConversationBufferWindowMemory`, meaning we only retain information from the last 2 conversations. 

Let's test this and see whether the model remembers the age we provided.

```python
# Check whether it knows the age we gave it

llm_chain.invoke({"input_prompt":"What is my age?"})
```

```markdown
{'input_prompt': 'What is my age?',
'chat_history': "Human: What is 3 + 3?\nAI: Hello again! 3 + 3 equals 6. If there's anything else I can help you with, just let me know!\nHuman: What is my name?\nAI: Your name is Maarten.",
'text': " I'm unable to determine your age as I don't have access to personal information. Age isn't something that can be inferred from our current conversation unless you choose to share it with me. How else may I assist you today?"}
```

As you can see in the response, the LLM outputs the expected information. It doesn't have access to the age information.

You can probably imagine that this could be an issue for lengthier conversations. Conversation Summary addresses that.

#### Conversation Summary
We see that the last 2 ways we can retain memory have issues, both regarding the context window. **Conversation Summary** completely addresses this as it is a technique that *summarizes* an entire conversation history to distill it into the main points. 

This gets rid or significantly reduces the impact of the number and the length of previous conversations.

The summarization process is handled by an **external LLM**. It is given the entire conversation history as input and asked to create a *concise* summary. 

![[Pasted image 20251023163256.png]]

This means that whenever we ask the LLM a question, there are **two calls:**
- **The user prompt**
- **The summarization prompt**

To use this in **LangChain**, we first need to prepare a summarization template that we will use as the summarization prompt:
```python
# Create a summary prompt template
summary_prompt_template = """<s><|user|>Summarize the
conversations and update with the new lines.

Current summary:
{summary}

new lines of conversation:
{new_lines}

New summary:<|end|>
<|assistant|>"""
summary_prompt = PromptTemplate(
	input_variables=["new_lines", "summary"],
	template=summary_prompt_template
)
```

Using `ConversationSummaryMemory` in LangChain is similar to what we did previously.

```python 
from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory

# Define the type of memory we will use
memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(
	llm=llm,
	memory_key="chat_history",
	prompt=summary_prompt
)

# Chain the LLM, prompt, and memory together
llm_chain = LLMChain(
	prompt=prompt,
	llm=llm,
	memory=memory
)
```

Let's test out its summarization capabilities:
```python
# Generate a conversation and ask for the name
llm_chain.invoke({"input_prompt": "Hi! My name is Maarten. What is 1 + 1?"})

llm_chain.invoke({"input_prompt": "What is my name?"})
```

```markdown
{'input_prompt': 'What is my name?',
'chat_history': ' Summary: Human, identified as Maarten, asked the AI about the sum of 1 + 1, which was correctly answered by the AI as 2 and offered additional assistance if needed.',
'text': ' Your name in this context was referred to as "Maarten". However, since our interaction doesn\'t retain personal data beyond a single session for privacy reasons, I don\'t have access to that information. How can I assist you further today?'}
```

After each step, conversations are summarized up to that point.

```python
# Check whether it has summarized everything thus far
llm_chain.invoke({"input_prompt": "What was the first question I asked?"})
```

```markdown
{'input_prompt': 'What was the first question I asked?',
'chat_history': ' Summary: Human, identified as Maarten in the context of this conversation, first asked about the sum of 1 + 1 and received an answer of 2 from the AI. Later, Maarten inquired about their name but the AI clarified that personal data is not retained beyond a single session for privacy reasons. The AI offered further assistance if needed.',
'text': ' The first question you asked was "what\'s 1 + 1?"'}
```

To get the most recent summary, we can access the memory variable we created previously:
```python
memory.load_memory_variables({})
```

```markdown
{'chat_history': ' Maarten, identified in this conversation, initially asked about the sum of 1+1 which resulted in an answer from the AI being 2. Subsequently, he sought clarification on his name but the AI informed him that no personal data is retained beyond a single session due to privacy reasons. The AI then offered further assistance if required. Later, Maarten recalled and asked about the first question he inquired which was "what\'s 1+1?"'}
```

This is more complicated than Conversation Buffer.
![[Pasted image 20251023165404.png]]

While this decreases the tokens used in the conversation by a lot,
its **disadvantage** is that the model would need to infer information from context since it doesn't have the explicit statements and queries.

Furthermore, multiple calls to the same LLM are needed, one for the prompt and one for the summarization. This can slow down the overall response generation.

Choosing between `ConversationSummaryMemory` and `ConversationBufferMemory` is about speed, accuracy, and memory.  `ConversationSummaryMemory` frees up tokens to use, but `ConversationBufferMemory` increases token use significantly.

#### Agents: Creating a System of LLMs
